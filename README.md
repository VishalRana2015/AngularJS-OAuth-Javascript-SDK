# AngularJS-OAuth-Javascript-SDK
Unlike Angular, React and Vue Auth0 doesn't provide any library written in AngularJS so that it can be integrated in applications written in AngularJS.<br/>
<br/>
In this project I have used Javascript library to integrate Auth0 in a sample application written in Angular to understand its suitability for applications written in AngularJS.<br/>
<br/> <br/>
Outcome: <br/>
We can use javascript library provided by Auth0 to integrate Auth0 in AngularJS applications, to understand its working, look at the code.
